**1. Grind Size:** Use a coarser grind to reduce over-extraction
**2. Water Temperature:** Lower to 85-90¬∞C (avoid boiling water)
**3. Brew Time:** Reduce steeping/brew time by 30 seconds
**4. Coffee Ratio:** Use less coffee (try 1:16 ratio instead of 1:15)

**Quick Test:** If you're using a French Press, try pressing 30 seconds earlier. For pour-over, grind coarser and pour faster.

Try adjusting these parameters and taste the difference! ‚òï`;

**1. Grind Finer:** Increase surface area for better extraction
**2. Hotter Water:** Use 92-96¬∞C for better extraction
**3. More Time:** Extend brew time by 30 seconds
**4. More Coffee:** Try 1:15 ratio instead of 1:16

**Pro Tip:** Light roasts need hotter water and finer grinds than dark roasts.

Getting the grind size right is the key to better extraction! üéØ`;

**Best Portable Method:** AeroPress
- Lightweight & virtually unbreakable
- Consistent results anywhere
- Easy cleanup

**Camping Recipe:**
- 18g coffee (medium-fine grind)
- 250ml water at ~85¬∞C
- 2 minute brew time
- Press slowly for 30 seconds

**Pro Camping Tips:**
- Pre-grind beans at home
- Bring a small scale if possible
- Use a thermal mug to keep it hot

Happy brewing on your adventures! üèïÔ∏è`;

1. **Good Grinder** - Makes 70% of the difference
2. **Brewing Method** - Matches your taste & lifestyle  
3. **Scale** - Consistency is key
4. **Quality Beans** - Fresh roasted within 2 weeks

**For Beginners:**
- French Press + Burr Grinder ($80-120 total)
- Simple, forgiving, great coffee

**For Coffee Geeks:**
- V60 + Premium Grinder ($150-250)
- More control, brighter flavors

**Altitude Effects (1000m+):**
- Water boils at lower temperatures (93-95¬∞C)
- Lower atmospheric pressure affects extraction
- Faster evaporation and cooling

**Brewing Adjustments:**
- Use slightly more coffee to compensate
- Extend brew time by 10-20%
- Grind slightly finer than usual
- Consider insulated brewing vessels

**Pro Tips:**
- Portable equipment is perfect for mountain adventures
- Bring extra coffee for stronger brews
- Pre-heat equipment to maintain temperature

Perfect for hiking and mountain camping! ü•æ`;

    // Default response
    return `ü§ñ Great coffee question! While I'd love to give you a detailed answer, I'm currently running in basic mode.

**Quick Coffee Tips:**
- **Golden Ratio:** 1g coffee to 15-16g water
- **Grind Fresh:** Within 15 minutes of brewing
- **Water Temp:** 85-95¬∞C depending on roast
- **Timing:** 2-6 minutes depending on method

**For Complex Questions:** Try asking about specific problems like "bitter coffee" or "weak extraction" - I have detailed help for those!

**Need Equipment?** Research different brewing methods to find what works best for you! ‚òï
